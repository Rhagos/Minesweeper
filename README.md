# Minesweeper
small minesweeper project that will recieve several modifications


Initial goals:
1. Create a representation of a minesweeper board
2. Enable rudimentary gameplay
3. Create a functional GUI (tkinter?)
4. Develop additional features (probability overlay? other modes?)

Far stretch (each ? means less likely):
1. Host it online???
2. Adapt it into another project??
3. Use it for a machine learning project?????
4. Suggestions that come through
